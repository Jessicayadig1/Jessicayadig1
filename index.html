		<p>I love data analysis, web design, programming, and am now a data scientist.</p> 

		<p>Areas of expertise: Business Consulting, Data Mining, Data Analysis, and Writing Business Plans for companies such as Ace Hardware, Private Ophthalmology Practices, and Comic Book Stores (to name a few).</p> 

		<p>My favorite hobby? Solving complex problems, of course! I have been building websites for many years, not only for fun, but also to help clients get a jump start on their starter companies.</p> 

		<p>I come from a long line of programmers, and my sense of humor regarding IT clearly shows it. To demonstrate, please watch one of my favorite clips from "The IT Crowd!" Click the Facebook Button to creep my Facebook
